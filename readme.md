Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [ReactJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
- [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
- [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
- [jQuery] - duh
- [jqvmap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jqvmap) - jQuery library for JVectorMap

And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
on GitHub.
